# This is a sensor simulation mini project.
 Assuming Temperature sensor, humidity sensor, proximity sensor were connected to the embedded device
 we are simulating the sensors in this project. 
 Sensor data collector module and appconfig agent module has been created.
 appconfig module reads json file and stores the time interval value which is required for further processing by sensor data collector module
 Sensor data collector module is going to receive the time interval value from app config agent module and accordingly collects sensor values from sensors.
